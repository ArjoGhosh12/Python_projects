Hello, I'm Arjo Ghosh, and I'm truly passionate about all things tech. As a tech enthusiast, I'm constantly on the lookout for the latest innovations, trends, and emerging technologies that shape our digital world. I believe that technology has the power to transform our lives, and I'm excited to be a part of this ever-evolving landscape.

My journey in the tech world has been an exhilarating one. From early coding adventures to developing intricate software solutions, I've had the privilege of delving deep into the realm of programming. With proficiency in multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++, I find joy in solving complex problems and creating elegant, efficient solutions.

 The primary objective of the game is to control the snake's movement, guide it to eat food items that appear on the game board, and avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.Players aim to achieve the highest score possible by controlling the snake's movements, strategically eating food, and avoiding collisions, making it both a fun and educational project for beginner and intermediate programmers.
